"""A package for performing Safe RL experiments

In this package, we define a general purpose, modular way to define deep RL
agents/algorithms and perform safety experiments on them. The bulk of the
simulations are carried out in OpenAI Gym compatible environments.

The algorithms in this package use `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`

We borrow ideas from the following libraries to design this package:

1. `Tensorforce <https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce>`
2. `DeepRL <https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/DeepRL>`
